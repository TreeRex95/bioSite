            <p class="biography">            
                &emsp;LaNeal is my ride or die. She is a selfless person who I swear is here to make others’ journeys better in life. Not ever focused on herself, 
                but always on her family, friends, and of course her daughter, Willow. Willow is almost 7 and as soon as she was born LaNeal’s life changed forever. 
                Not always the easiest at times, but always worth it. All she has is love for that child and wants nothing more than for Willow to have everything she 
                didn’t have. LaNeal is determined for Willow to grow up with unconditional love. Giving validation that every child deserves, breaking down the 
                generation trauma. 
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;What seems forever ago, LaNeal attended college to become a cosmetologist. Something she never thought was possible to be able to do by herself, 
                but she did it! Not only did she work, and support her daughter (by herself), but she also graduated with a degree in something that she very much 
                enjoys. LaNeal is working as a nail technician and has been for XXXX within that short amount of time she has grown exponentially and is going to branch 
                out on her own. Not only will she be closer to home, but this will be her business: La’ Nails (clever, right?). She has toughed out a lot of things to 
                be able to get to this point in life, but she is very close to making her dreams come true and her daughter’s life even better.
                <br /><br />
                &emsp;Some things that LaNeal enjoys when she is not working or taking care of everyone and everything else, are gaming and anything related to 
                astrology and spirituality. At times this can be hard, she is very in tune with her emotions and others’ emotions as well and it takes a toll on her 
                but nevertheless, she keeps her head held high and also enjoys resting on the very few days she is able to. I am excited to see where life takes this 
                wonderful soul. She never ceases to amaze me.
